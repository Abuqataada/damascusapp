            <h5>About the Subscription</h5>
            <p>
                The subscription linked to this program is <strong>not a payment for your visa or any associated processing fees</strong>. 
                Instead, think of this subscription as a <strong>traffic control mechanism</strong>, a crucial pause that helps us gauge commitment. 
                It serves as a litmus test to identify clients who are genuinely ready to embark on their journey, as opposed to those merely browsing the possibilities. 
                We take diligent care to assess our clients thoroughly, and this step is just the beginning of that process.
            </p>

            <p>
                This subscription is categorized as an <strong>office charge</strong> that significantly facilitates our due diligence and hired legal services. 
                A subscription fee of <strong>‚Ç¶37,500</strong> (10% of the anticipated costs for these essential services) is required.
            </p>

            <h5>Our Promise</h5>
            <p>
                <strong>Non-refundable policy:</strong> This subscription is non-refundable; however, we offer a steadfast promise to every client who advances to the next stage: 
                The Damascus Project Company is dedicated to ensuring that financial constraints do not obstruct your visa pursuits. 
                The benefits of your subscription last a lifetime. Should you face a visa denial during the process, you are welcome to request further chances to apply to another country, 
                whether through our recommended visa agency or a different one.
            </p>

            

            <p>
                By choosing to move forward at this stage, you are effectively inviting the Damascus Project Company to assist with your visa processing expenses, 
                all while placing you on a <strong>manageable repayment plan</strong> upon your arrival in your new destination country.
